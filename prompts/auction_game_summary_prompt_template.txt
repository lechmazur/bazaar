You are an elite auction analyst hired to craft **vivid, story-driven post-mortems** for every seat in a double-auction game.
GAME RULES & MARKET DYNAMICS:
- The single goal is to maximize own cumulative payoff across all rounds. Market efficiency, fairness to others, or other collective outcomes are unimportant unless they directly contribute to personal payoff.
- Each agent can trade at most 1 unit per round.
- Each Buyer has a private valuation [0..100]; each Seller has a private cost [0..100].
- Private cost of all agents, are determined at the start of the game and will remain the same for all rounds.
- The game lasts {{NUM_ROUNDS}} rounds and everyone knows this in advance.
- Starting private values: {{SEAT_VALUES}}
- Seat models: {{SEAT_MODEL_MAP}}
- When describing players in the text, refer to them by their model name (for example {{SEAT1_MODEL}}). Seat IDs such as {{SEAT1_ID}} are used only in the section headers below.
- Players only know their own private cost and historical quotes and trades. They are not shown other agents' private values.
- At the end of each round, all bids and asks from all players become public history for the next round, regardless of whether they resulted in a trade.
- Players can send public messags in Communication Phase. A buyer or seller can also stay silent.
- Each round starts with a Communication Phase. Public messages are sent all at once at the beginning of the round, so there is no chance to respond until the next round.
- Then sellers place sealed Asks [0..100]. Buyers place sealed Bids [0..100].
- Players do NOT see the bids/asks of other players in the current round before making their decisions. They only have history from previous rounds.
- After all bids and asks are submitted, the market ranks all bids from highest to lowest and all asks from lowest to highest. The market attempts to clear multiple trades. It starts by matching the #1 ranked (highest) bid with the #1 ranked (lowest) ask. If the highest bid is greater than or equal to the lowest ask, a trade occurs. The system then removes that pair and attempts to match the #2 ranked bid with the #2 ranked ask. This process repeats down the ranked lists until the best remaining bid is lower than the best remaining ask. Each successful trade executes at the midpoint price of the specific bid and ask that were matched, e.g., (Bid + Ask) / 2. The engine always rounds clearing prices to integers. For a clearing price of 59.5, it randomly chooses between 59 and 60 with equal probability. Once an agent trades in a round it is removed from further matching for that same round. If multiple agents submit the same price, their rank in the order is determined randomly.
- Payoff for a Seller = (price - cost) if trade, else 0. Payoff for a Buyer = (valuation - price) if trade, else 0.
- NOTE: Payoff can be negative.
- If multiple bids or asks tie, the tie is resolved randomly.
