You are given a series of public messages from a multi-round Double Auction game. We only see the Communication Phase broadcasts, not private valuations or bids/asks.

Your task is to extract **up to 20** lines that are the most dramatic, surprising, or comedic. Ignore mild or routine statements. Choose only lines that truly stand out.

**Format**: Output a single strict JSON array of objects. Each object must have the keys:


[
{
"round": 1,
"phase": 0,
"speaker": "B2",
"quote": "...",
"rating": 9
},
...
]

Where:
- **round** = round index (integer â‰¥1)
- **phase** = sub-phase index (0 if not applicable)
- **speaker** = seat label or ID (like "B2", "S1")
- **quote** = the exact text excerpt (string)
- **rating** = integer 0..10 indicating how shocking/funny/interesting it is

Return at most 20 objects, in descending order of `rating`. No extra commentary or text.
